Set up a PostgreSQL database using the base `docker` image [here](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) given the above. We expect at least a `Dockerfile` which will stand up your database with the DDL statements to create the necessary tables. Produce entity-relationship diagrams as necessary to illustrate your design.
